Senior Fullstack Developer · UI/UX Enthusiast · Technical Writer

I'm a Brazilian developer with 10+ years of experience building full-featured web apps using **Laravel**, **Livewire**, and **Vue** — lately diving deeper into **React**, **Astro.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js**.

I love crafting clean, efficient code and intuitive user interfaces.
Design isn't just a bonus for me — it's part of the solution.

✍️ I also write articles (in PT/EN) about web dev, product thinking, and the developer journey.

Expertise in developing and implementing complex features and functionalities using Laravel's MVC architecture and Eloquent ORM. Strong knowledge of Vue.js framework and its component-based structure. Experience in working with and integrating RESTful APIs.

TL;DR:

- 🧠 Laravel Expert, APIs and monorepos.
- ✨ Beatifull frontends using Livewire, Vue, React, and Astro.js
- 🎨 Passionate about clean UI and great UX.
- 🔍 Always learning new things.
- 🖊️ Starting writing about code.
- 💙 In love with Next.js.
- 🧡 In love with FilamentPHP.
